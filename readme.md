<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a take on the Pig game. A die is set with some particular value showing on the die face. The player starts with a score of six. The player then throws the die. If the face is a six then the game is over and the player still has a score of six. On the other hand if the die face is not six then the player loses one point and throws again. This process continues until either the player has thrown a six or the player’s score has become equal to zero. The aim of the game is to throw a six before the player’s score reaches zero.
